<h1>A man shall not CRY in public.</h1>

<img src="photo/ONE/cry.jpg">

<p>  If a man is accused of a crime and his evidence exonerates
him from the allegations he will still be prosecuted and deemed guilty.</p>



<p> If he cries, his tears will jail him because the jury believes 
a man who cries is a weak man who should serve as an example in that jurisprudential argument.</p> 

<p> But if a woman is accused of a crime and the evidence
adduced is meritorious and overwhelming then her tears and emotions will exonerate her.</p> 

<p>  The jury will focus on her tears, not on the merit of the accusation. 
This is because the jury believes a woman is a weak being who should be protected.</p>

<p>  Men are judged by the image of their character and reputation</p>
<p>  While women are judged by the image of their vulnerability and weakness.</p>

<p> Women know the world conflates beauty with innocence therefore 
they use this handicap to defeat judicial restitution.</p> 

<p> The bar of justice for women is low.</p>

<p> This corollary cannot be different if a woman is accusing a man of a crime against her.</p>

    <p> If a woman accuses a man, the jury will use the accusations to identify gaps 
on how to prosecute and jail the man instead of using the man's rebuttal to dismiss the accusations.</p>

<p> That is how high the bar of justice for men is placed.</p>
<p>Therefore, A man shall not CRY in public.</p>





<h1>A man shall not CRY in public.</h1>

<p>   No matter the depth of stuitation<br>

<strong> Lose of property ,<br>

Lose of a loved one,<br> 

Dumped by a woman.</strong></p>

<p>  Keep your tears to yourself.

<p>  Let your tears drop into your stomach , not your checks .

    <p>  <strong>This is why man shall not cry? </strong></p>

        <p>  As a man, during a difficult time ,  everyone is looking up to you for support.</p> 

            <p>  You are the pillar of the moment.</p> 

                <p>  Stand tall and resolute .</p> 

                    <p>  Be the oak tree in times of a storm .</p> 

                        <p>  If a man wants to cry , go lock yourself in privacy .</p> 

                            <p>  Painful cry in privacy .<br>

Painful meditate.<br> 

Punch a wall<br> 
-or go to the gym and  lift heavy weights .</p> 

<p>  The pain you will experience in the gym is weakness leaving your body.</p> 
<p>  Refuse to be weak and stop listen to emotional advice from your fellow weak friends and women</p>

<p><strong>Do you know why suicide in men is on rise?</strong></p>

<p> Because we have made men cry in Public,</p>

<p> Instead of encouraging them to face their demons head-on with fierce combat. </p> 

<p> If a man commits suicide because of  whatever reason,</p> 
<p>Then his weak gene has been eliminated from gene pool.</p>  

<p> Do you think if you cry or commit suicide the  world will care or stop?</p> 

<p> We shall say sorry and tomorrow we shall be in your woman's panties as talk about your weakness.</p> 


<p><strong>Listen,</strong></p>

<p> The world is rough and ruthless against boys and men .

<p>  It offers no sympathy for you.</p> 

<p> It will never pamper you. </p> 

<p> Whether you cry , complain or whine , it doesn't care!</p> 

<p> It is you against yourself forever.</p> 

<p> Therefore, don't show anger in public,<br>

Don't cry in public,<br>

Don't show outrage in public,<br>

Don't shout at your wife in public,<br>

Public display of emotions is a weakness .</p> 

<p>  Emotions lead to chaos and embarrassment. </p> 

<p> Detach yourself from feminine emotions . It's for women</p>  

<p> If you cry , nobody will sympathize with you.</p> 

<p> â€” In fact, you will be punished severely for crying .</p> 

<p> If you want to cry , go and punch your bedroom wall and cry inside your room. 

Not in public.</p> 

<p> Or if you " feel " you want to cry ,<br>

Go lock yourself in the room<br>

Do 27 press ups<br>

Do wall sits for 3 minutes & 17 seconds<br>

Punch the wall for 1 minute & 9 seconds<br>

Then, after that, see if the  " feelings " is there.</p> 


<p><strong> What kind of a man are you, please? </strong></p>

<p> Some men even cry when a woman dumps them.</p>



<p>  Unplug yourself from this feminized circuit and RECREATE YOURSELF.</p> 

<p>  Handle rejection with utmost brevity.</p> 

<p>  Don't cry or lose your mind. </p> 

<p>  You cry or get depressed because you lack purpose in life.</p>  

<p>  ecause your life was oscillating around her. </p> 

<p>  She dumped you and She is gone.</p> 

<p>  Now, get up! Go chase your goals. </p> 

<p> The world doesn't care .</p> 

<p> Our ancestors did not fight wars for you to cry because of rejection </p> 

<p>  our father did not pay your tuition for you to cry because of a woman.</p> 

    <p>   Why do you cry because of a woman who fears a cockroach? </p>

        <p>   Rejection is part of a man's life.</p>

            <p>  Before you cry,<br> 

Go to a construction site and mix 12 wheelbarrows of ballast.<br>
 earn your pay

-and go take a cold shower then sleep</p>


<p> <strong> A Mans life is Dogs life</strong></p>


<p>  -and nobody cares about your pitfalls . 

    <p> Not even your woman!</p>

        <p> Whether you cry your lungs out, </p>

            <p> Or, lock and isolate yourself in your house,</p>

                <p>The world doesn't care about your depression ,</p>

                    <p> Get up, fight your demons , and keep moving forward and upward.</p> 

                        <p>Keep your negative emotions away from your woman.</p>

                                <p> Emotions like anger, lamentation, & pitifulness should be defeated.</p>
                                <p> Women hate men who always cry about everything.</p> 
                                        <p>  She won't hesitate to dump & replace you.</p> 

                                        <p>  Build a stoic , unbowed frame .
<p><strong>And,</strong></p>

<p>   If your marriage or relationship has collapsed</p> 

<p>  Don't go telling people or writing on social media seeking sympathy,</p>  

<p>   You are the man.</p> 

<p>   Don't explain shit to anyone. </p> 

<p>  Let the woman rant and throw tantrums .</p> 

<p>   That's none of your business.</p> 
<p>  Keep quiet and focus .</p> 

 <p><strong>Also , </strong></p>

 <p>  When you disagree with your woman,</p> 

<p>  Don't show annoyance and anger ,</p> 

<p>  Don't refuse to eat if she cooks.</p> 

<p> Eat the food.</p> 

<p>  When you finish eating the food, pin her, give a hard sex </p> 

<p>  A man must remain emotionless during a disagreement.</p>
