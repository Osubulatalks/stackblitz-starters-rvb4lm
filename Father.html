<h1> A FATHER.</h1>
<p class="meta-info">Published on February 18, 2024 by Osubulatalks. Category: Masculinity</p>
<img src="photo/father.jpeg">


<p>A father is a biological progenitor of a child.</p>

<p> A father gives life. He transmits the seeds of his bloodline to his child, here, the son or daughter.</p>

<p>  Every father must raise his children.</p>
    
    <p>  Do not abdicate this responsibility to another man.</p>

    <p> If you luck the capacity to be a father, do not sleep with women carelessly like a fool.</p>

<p>  However, if the mother of the child becomes difficult, leave her alone.</p>

<p> Once the child becomes an adult, he will notice something missing in his life.</p>

<p> He will experience emptiness and hollowness. </p>

    <p>  He will look for you. </p>

        <p>  A father gives his child the self-identity that pushes hime to actualize his dreams.</p>

<p>Father is the pinnacle of order. </p>

<p>  He is the leader in that family.</p>

    <p> He provides structures and laws in which a mother and the children are supposed 
to confine themselves within.</p>

<p>  father ensures that these order is a feared to a nobody goes against the orders.</p>

<p> A father is an important pillar in anyone's life. </p>

<p>  I can confirm to you that adults who grew up without a father understand 

the gap that their absent father left in their lives.</p>

A father is the moral compass of every person. </p>

<p>  Without a father, we are all left to wander the world aimlessly. </p>

    <p>   It is therefore important that every adult (especially a woman)
who grew up without a dad to look for their father.</p>

<p>If you are a man, there is no escape, you must connect with your father.</p> 
    
    <p>   Connecting with your father or his roots is the most important thing you can do for yourself.</p>

<p> Forget the money, 
the cars and the careers,</p>

<p> Just connect with your father and see how your gates of opportunities open wide.</p>

<p>   Most of our moral or mental or spiritual problems which affect our physical
     lives are due to our disconnect from our fathers.</p>
    
  <p> Don't listen to your mother and don't side with her. </p>

  <p>   There are chances that she is preventing you from meeting your father</p> 
    
  <p>  Because you might know the truth and discover her duplicity.</p>

  <p>   Just meeting your father gives you a sigh of relief in life. </p>

  <p>   It eases the tension that has been in your chest for years.</p>
    
  <p>  It gives you catharsis.</p>

            <h1>FATHERLESSNESS.</h1>

       <img src="photo/fatherless.jpg">


    
       <p>There are two causes of fatherlessness, according to several studies,
         which have been carried around the world.</p>

   <p>  <strong> 1. Out of wedlock</strong><br>
       <strong> 2. Divorce</strong></p>  

      <p>   The first one is out of wedlock but from studies in the 1960s up to today, 
        the numbers keep rising more and more out of <strong>wedlock.</strong></p>
        
     <p>  The second course is <strong>divorced.</strong> Still studies have identified <strong>divorce</strong> as one of the major courses of fatherlessness with continued 
        rising numbers every year since 1960.</p>
    
    <h1>CONSEQUENCES OF FATHERLESSNESS</h1>

        <p>So lack of a father is a very detrimental thing in a family especially a family that is growing.</p>
            
        <p>   But families where father is missing, faces a lot of disorder.</p>   

        <p>    You can't tell who is listening to who and none of them has a purpose
         on what they are doing in that family.</p> 
        
    <p>There are problems that are rampant in families that lack fathers.</p>  

    <p>   The chaos, pettiness and drama we witness in the current 
    generation of young men are because they luck fathers in their lives.</p>  

    <p>    The violence and chaos in marriages today are 
    because the men lacked fathers in their lives. </p>  
    
    <p>    Fatherlessness is a bigger problem than we assume.</p>
    
    <p>Normally I watch boys from Fatherless homes and I sympathize with them. </p>  
        
    <p>     They are lonely and sullen. </p>  
        
        <p>    There is no mam to talk to them and give them affirmation.</p>   

        <p>    Their egos get crushed when their neighboring friends have fathers.</p>   
    
    <p>   They see their friends walk, play with their fathers and their wish is also to have a father walk, 
    play with them.</p> 
    
    <p> Fatherless homes are families where the father is absent or present but absent. 
        
        <p>   Boys need fathers than the they want mothers.</p>  
        <p>  Most of these chaotic and manerless boys are Fatherless.</p>
    
      <p>They walk around with a lot of femine energy in their lives.</p>
        
      <p>  They lack fathers to instil discipline, 
        morals and values in their lives.</p>
        
        <p>  They do not know boundaries.
        
            <p>  They do not know when to talk and when to keep quiet.
        
                <p>  They do not know when to hear and when to listen. 

      <p>   Femine energy is a burden in the lives of men. this must be offloaded pronto. 
        
        <p> Fatherless boys are dangerous boys if not raised well. 
        
            <p>  Also, sons who have not been fathered well are dangerous.</p>
    
        <p>A Fathers provide visionary leadership, 
            they show the family where they're supposed to go to, but lack of a father, 
            makes a family stagnant.</p>

            <p>  They lack goals, they lack plans, they don't know what to do, 
        because that pillar of a family who is the father is missing.</p>
    
      <p> The other problem that fatherless families face is Insecurity.</p>
        
        <p>   A father is a point of protection.</p>
        
            <p>  He protects his family from external and internal threats.</p> 
        
                <p>  He protects his family
             from risks that may decimate that family.</p> 

             <p>    A father plays a role of building a buffer in that family that 
            the family may withstand any internal or external shock.</p>
    
    
    <p>The other thing, that is a problem in a fatherless Family is misbehavior.</p>

    <p>    Where there is no father, there will be misbehavior, 
        everyone will be misbehaving from the mother to the children.</p> 
        
     <p>A mother has no point of reference when it comes to a moral compass.</p>

     <p>   So she will misbehave. She will do whatever she wants to. </p>
        
        <p>   Do not understanding the consequences of what she is doing. </p>

            <p>  If a father is there, he will point out the consequences of the habits and behaviors.</p>
    
      <p> Children will misbehave because there is no one to reprimand them </p>
        
        or there is no one to give a very strong punishment. 
        
        <p>  If they go against the order that has been laid by their pillar of the family, 
        who is the father, they will be punished.</p>
    
    <p>The other problem is emotional deficiency.</p>
        
        <p> A family where a father is missing has a lot of emotional deficiencies, because
         a father is a wet sponge for soaking.</p>

         <p>   Emotions of the family, The mother and the children are 
            able to place their emotions on their father.</p>

            <p>   But if a father is lacking, this family fails to understand 
                or fails to manage their emotions.</p> 
        
       <p>Therefore, their emotions become scattered broken. </p>

        <p>  They therefore, carry this emotions to their next life. </p>
        
            <p>   For example, if their children and when they grow up, 
        they carry this emotions to their next families. </p>
        
        <p>   So a father is a very important pillar in any given family.</p>
    
    
        <p>Poverty Children in father absent homes are almost four times more 
            likely to be poor.</p>
            
            <p>   Studies have said that 12% of children
             in married Couple families were living in poverty compared to 44% of 
             children in single mother homes. </p>
             
            <p>Children living 
            in single mother homes. Had a poverty rate of almost 50%. </p>
            
            <p> That is four times the rate in families, where a father is present.</p> 

                <p>   The other consequence of fatherlessness is drugs and alcohol abuse Fatherless
              Children are at dramatically greater risk of drugs and alcohol abuse.</p>
            
           <p> Physical and emotional ill health. </p>
            
            <p>  Children living with both parents had significantly fewer externalizing and internalizing 
            behavioral problems Compared to children in fatherless homes.</p> 
            
            <p>  Children of fatherless homes are more likely to commit suicide than children 
            in families where a father is present.</p>
            
         <p>Poor educational outcomes. </p>
            <p>   Families were fathers are involved in schools that is the goal to academic day sports day.</p> 
                <p>    They are part of their children's educational development. </p>

                    <p>   Have seen their children achieve better in class compared to
                         children where the father is absent.</p> 

           <p>  Father involvement in schools is associated with likelihood of 
            a student performing better in class.</p>
    
    
    <p>Criminal activities. Fatherless families are more likely to engage in crime, 
        compared to those who are living in homes where a father is present. </p>
        
        <p>   Because when a father is there, he will supervise, he will monitor. 
        He will be close to his children.<br> 

        <p> They are able to be obedient and follow the rules of the family 
    rules of the school and rules of society.</p>
    
      <p>  Early sexual debut and teen pregnancy.</p> 
        <p>   These are correlation between fatherlessness and self-reported sexual activity. </p>
        
            <p>  Fatherless homes are more likely to report being sexual active that is sexual debut.</p> 

                <p>  The first day they start having sex compared to adolescence who live with their fathers.</p>

<h1>LOOK FOR YOUR FATHER AND CONNECT WITH YOUR BLOODLINE.</h1>

<img src="photo/meet.jpg">

<h1>CONNECTING WITH YOUR FATHER.</h1>



<p>Growing up fatherless is the most dismaying experience for any man. </p>

<p>  Every sane fatherless man in adulthood who is concerned about his lineage, ancestry,
bloodline, roots and mental point of origin is 
genuinely determined to connect with his father.</p>

<p>However, the moment you meet your father for the first time, 
know what to expect and how to behave. </p> 

<p>  You have been raised by your mother therefore, 
there is high chance that you don't know mannerism 
of fathers and son relationship.</p>

<p>Since you grew up soaking alot of Feminine energy from your mother,  you don't understand how 
a son relate with his father. 

<p>  Or you don't understand how a African fathers behave.</p> 

<p>  Remember an African fathers are not like soy fathers 
of America like the ones you see on movies and  tiktok. </p>

<h1>how to connect with your FATHER for the first time. </h1>

<strong><p>1. Meet him physically first before having phone calls.</p></strong>

<p>No messages and Whatsapp texts. </p>

<p>    No unnecessary calls. </p>

<p>  He is not your girlfriend.</p> 

<p>  Don't nag him and start begging for money.</p> 

<p>  He might think you have been sent by your mother to milk him. </p>

<p>  He will block you.</p>

<strong><p>2. Be discipline.</p></strong>

<p>Don't be rude and stupid. He is not your agemate.</p>

<p>  Focus on your goals.</p> 

<p>  He will recognize you more if you are committed to your goals and dreams.</p>

<p>  When meet your father, Do not tell your mother about the things you talked when you met your father.</p> 

<p>  Keep them secret.</p> 

<p>  He will tell you more masculine secrets that you did not know.</p>


<p>  But if you are a loose mouth telling those secrets to your mother, he will block you. </p>

<p>  Stay away from his wife. She is not your mother. 
She is not your blood.</p>

<strong><p>3. Be thanful.</p></strong>


<p>Be thankful you met your father.</p>

<p>   Don't ask him why he left your mother.</p> 

<p>   That is none of your business. </p>

<p>  Minimize contact with him.</p> 

<p>  Talk to him when necessary.</p>

<p>  When you start a project, tell him. He can advise you.</p>

<p>  Say a word of prayer for him every morning. </p>

<p>  Some fathers live with demons they call wives and their
spiritual lives are chaotic.</p>

<strong><p>3. You father is not your agemate and he is not like your mother.</p></strong>

<p>Your father is not your classmate.</p> 

<p>   Don't expect him to start chatting with you. He is also not your friend.</p> 

<p>    Don't think he will befriend you. </p>

<p>You are used sitting with your mother gossiping and discus effeminate stories.</p>

<p>    Your father is not your mother. Father are not mothers.</p>

<p>   They are fathers. He will not smile with you. </p>

<p>Your father will not praise you. Even if you do something worthwhile.</p> 

<p>   He will just observe and keep quiet. He may not even comment. </p>

<p>    This because he is your teacher. </p>

<p>   He expects you to use your common sense.</p>

<p>Don't expect gifts from your father.</p>

<p>  He is not your woman to shower with gifts.</p> 

<p>  He will even ignore you. </p>

<p>   He will sometimes say harsh words to test your spirit and 
to see how you react to issues.</p>        

<h1>Way foward. </h1>

<p>Once you meet your father for the first time, this is the right step you have taken so far.</p> 

<p>  However, don't nag and pester your father. He will ignore and block you.</p>

<p>  Don't start calling and texting him all the time. That's disrespect.  </p>

<p>Only call him if need advice or starting project, business anything of value.</p> 

<p>    He will recognize you as focused man.</p>

<p>  Just focus on your goals.</p> 

<p>  He wants you to be independent, productive man for him to bless you with his heritage.</p>

<p>Remember, He is careful.</p> 

<p>  You may not understand the reason why he disagreed with your mother.</p> 

<p>  Probably your mother disrespect him or 
abuse him and took him to the children's court.</p>

<p>  He is therefore very cautious that your mother must have sent you to him.</p>

<p>  He doesn't want anything to do with your mother.</p> 

<p>  He thinks your mother has sent you to sneak back to his life as a wife.</p>


<p>Don't listen to your mother.</p>

<p>  Don't accept her skewed stories that paint your father as a bad man.</p> 

<p>  She will even tell you that your stepmother witched your father.</p>

<p>  Don't listen to her stories.</p>

<p>Since you ready know your father now,that's is enough.</p>

<p>   Don't nag him. </p>

<p>   Don't expect him to call you and pumper you like your mother does.

He will not. </p>

<p>  Just appreciate the you know him and know your roots.</p>

<p>  That's enough. Now work hard.</p> 

<p>  Focus ahead and build your own kingdom. </p>

<p>There is a reason children born out of wedlock who focus, 
end up becoming better than those born in settled marriages.</p>

<p>  This is because the know there is no inheritance for them.</p> 

<p>  They know between them and the future, is there sweat and blood will determine.</p>


<p>Children are becoming more and more proud of their identity and ancestry, 
hence the desire to know your father wether dead or live. </p>



<p> <strong>Finally,</strong><br>


No father is a "deadbeat" No father will abandon his children for expediency. </p>

<p>   "Deadbeat" is a word used by chaotic women to shame men who refused to be manipulated.</p>

<p>  They use babies as a source of income to fund their 
wretched lives of sex, eating Pizzas, alcohol and parties.</p>

<p>  It is about their self-interest and has nothing to do with the welfare of the children. </p> 

<p>You will never hear a woman who sired with a poor man call him a "dead beat".

<p>   In fact, she will protect him. </p>
<p>  It is only a "deadbeat" if the MAN refused to manipulated.</p>

<p>However, there is no father who will willingly abandon his child.</p> 

<p>  Unless, the father has met a barrier, chaos and unfriendly demands from the woman,</p>

<p>  Then, he will cunningly avoid further engagement. </p>

<p>  He may seek diplomacy to father the baby but more than less,

<p>  The woman adamantly escalates her 
demands and conditions to the chagrin of the father. </p>


<p>When the father refuses to be manipulated, the woman throws tantrums, shames the man and provokes his spirit.</p> 

<p>  She blockades access, brainwashes the children and poisons her close relatives and acquaintances to arm-twist 
their perception of the father. </p>

<h1>WHY ARE YOU HATING YOUR FATHER?</h1>

<img src="photo/father2.jpg">


<p>  A lot of children, men and women have issues with their father.</p>

<p> If they had the other side of the story, his side(father's side) 
they would maybe understand him or worse even have issues with their mothers too.</p>

<p>If you are a man or woman who dislikes or hates your father,</p>

<p> Be it for being absent or leaving your mother, </p>

<p> As a man, I want you to look at it in this <strong>ANGLES</strong>:</p>

<h1>angle 1</h1>

<p>What if that absent father you loathe, dislike or hate so much,</p>

<p> Was prevented from being in your life by your mother as some form of punishment for what happened between them?</p>

<p> What if that father who you accuse of not loving you, Never planned or wanted to have you in the first place? </p>

<p> Yes, you were a mistake, from a one night stand</p>

<p>What if you realise you were born as a result of your mother trying to trap a man by getting pregnant for him?</p> 

<p> Yes, your mother was so desperate to force that man to commit to her by getting pregnant.</p> 

<p>What if your father left because your mother cheated? </p>

<p> Yes, to protect whatever dignity a child should have towards his/her mother he never told you she cheated?. </p>

<p> What if you were to learn that your mother wasn't even sure who was your father because she slept with different men?</p>

<p> Yes, your mother was promiscuous in her youths </p>

<p>Therefore, open yourself to this harsh reality and you cease to worship women/mothers, 

<p>   They're flawed just like men/fathers.</p> 

<p> Even if you've never understood your parents motivations for doing some things in the past that hurt you, </p>

<p> You are better off forgiving them and starting afresh rather than holding grudges against them.</p> 

<p> They definitely did the best to their knowledge at the time.</p>

<p>As a man, you never really know who your mother is until you grow up. </p>

<p> It's only when you're grown, that you'll begin to see your mother the way your father saw her,</p> 

<p> Not the way she presented herself to you while you were growing up. </p>

<p>It is indeed true that mothers are loved; while fathers are respected.</p> 

<p> And this is why we have songs, poems that praise mothers to the skies but hardly one for fathers.</p> 

<p> A good father is never genuinely loved until his children become their own parents.</p>

<h1>angle 2</h1>

<p>Supposing you were in a relationship with a woman, Then she became pregnant,</p>

<p> Then she delivered, Then she became chaotic and left with your child,</p>

<p> Then you attempt to access your child,</p>

<p> Then she goes to court and forces you to pay child support,</p>

<p> So, you are paying child support but denied access to your child. </p>

<p>Then you decide to accept this fate, albeit painful. Then you marry another woman and raise a family</p>. 

<p> Then when child A becomes an adult, you learn that he dislikes you because his mother told him you are an irresponsible man.</p> 

<p> You learn that he was brainwashed to hate you yet the problem was his mother. </p>

<p>Then you decide to stay very far away from him and his mother. </p>

<p>   Then you learn that the child is saying you are irresponsible and you hate him.</p> 

<p> He is also saying you are a bad man and he cannot respect you.</p>

    <p> This is how dangerous listening to your mother can make you hate your father for no reason.</p>

<p>You were not there when they disagreed, so why are you actively listening to your mother?</p>

<p> You are a mama's boy and you must change. Look for your father and connect with him.</p>

<h1>angle 3</h1>

<p>Take it from someone who knows the importance of a father and the impact of losing one.</p> 

<p> Forgive your father for not playing his part as you think he ought to have.</p> 

<p>  Enough with the accusations & belittling “If my father was rich, I won’t be suffering today”</p> 

<p>  or “What was he doing when his mates were making money?”,</p> 

<p>  it’s not like his father passed wealth to him & he wasted it </p>

<p>Once you start making money and have people depend on you for their survival, you’d know how hard a father’s role is.</p> 

<p>  I believe fathers aren’t appreciated enough, a lot of them do embarrassing jobs, take disrespect from their bosses,</p> 

<p>  work endlessly barely resting, just to make money to take care of their families </p>

<p>Even if your father is a poor man, still respect him.</p> 

<p>  Know this, no man will be at peace with him being unable to provide for his home. </p>

<p>  He might not show it, but it eats him every single day.</p> 

<p>  And don't think he's too lazy to think of plan or implement it, life happens, things don't always go according to plan.</p>

<p>  But know this, every father wishes to be a father his children would be proud of </p>


<p>That your father is a drunkard isn't a reason to disrespect him.</p>

<p>  Sometimes the only escape he has from thoughts of 
failing to live up to your expectations is through the bottle. </p>

<p>  Cut him slack, nothing stresses a man than the inability to give his children the world they deserve.</p>

<p>Respect your father regardless of his status in society & his financial situation.</p> 

<p>   You have to obey him. You have to love him.</p> 

<p>  You must understand his life path & mistakes.</p> 

<p>  You are a man, you will make mistakes as well. Respect him.</p> 

<p>  Learn the game of life. Don't be stupid! life happens.</p>

<h3>BAD, IRESSPONSIBLE OR UNCOUTH FATHERS</h3>



<p>In as much as I encourage you to connect with your father, I also discourage you from connecting with 
irreparably damaged fathers.</p> 

<p>  These are men with filthy souls and messed up spiritual lives. </p>

<p>   The moment you connect with them, 
then your life will begin going down the drain.</p> 

<p>  However, You have to be very careful not to listen to your mother. </p>

<p> If it is your mother telling you "Your father is X and Y", then ignore it.  
She wants to completely disconnect you from him</p>

<p>Therefore do not take your mother's hatred towards your father as plain truth.</p>
    
<p>    In the event that it is true and you have evidence about your father’s uncouth character, then leave it at that.</p> 
    
<p>    Focus on building yourself and fixing your frame of life. </p>
    
<p>   Connecting with your father is for people who have never met their father.</p> 
    
<p>    If you already know your father, then the only thing you can do is respect
     him and have a good relationship with him.</p>

<p>It is true your father might have been the bad, irresponsible or uncouth father.</p>

<p>  But that is information you got from your mother who still angry and resentful.</p>

<p>   You were not there when he left your mother or he didn’t tell you why he left her and never returned.</p>

<p>  If you try to get closed to your father and he is not committed to connect with you, just understand him.</p>

<p><strong>Let me tell;</strong></p>

<p>  Sometimes a woman can frustrate you as much as possible when you try to meet your child.</p>

<p>   She will build a blockade around children while suing you in a court of law for child support.</p>

<p>  You will be still working hard to put your life together while she continues
drawing money from your pays lip as she enjoys this money with other men.</p>

<p>At this point, she still blocks you from accessing your children while <strong>indoctrinating</strong> 
them that, “your father is an irresponsible man”</p>

<p>  It is at this point that as a man you say;</p>

<p>  “Enough is enough. </p>
    
<p>      I have suffered enough in the cruel hands of this woman and from today I 
don’t want anything to do with this woman and those children forever”</p>

<p>You go ahead to marry another woman and focus on your life while erasing any memories with that woman.</p>

<p>  Then, 15 years later, BOOM! You get a message that your children whom you sired with the other woman are looking for you.</p>

<p>   Will you be happy? Definitely, you will be nurse thought of resent and anger.</p>

<p>So if your father becomes uninterested in you as you try to connect with him, just calm down.</p>

<p>  Understand him. Understand his pain. Understand his memories.</p>

<p>  Don’t be quick to judge him and say “mum was right. He hates me.”</p>

<p>   He is still, probably resentful.</p>

<p> His salary was halved for 15 years, his title deed was taken away from him,</p>

<p>    or his property was repossessed from him by your mother and then she sold it.</p>

<p>   Don’t be quick to judge a man.</p>

<p>  Me go through a lot because the system is gynocentric.</p> 

<p>   They system is rigged against the man and that man includes YOU!</p>

<p>   What does this all mean? Emasculation and feminism at its worst.</p>

<p>Why would a boy learn to forget about his ancestry and lineage and associate himself with his mother's side?</p>

<p>  They depend on their mother for everything, and even during marriage, 
heir mothers choose their wives for them.</p>

<p> Some men have told me how they telephoned their fathers or texted who in return ignored or blocked them.</p> 

<p>Yes, your father did the right thing to ignore or block you. </p>

<p>   Do you think he is your agemate or your mother?</p>

<p>  Once you meet in him for the first time,</p>  

<p>   just focus on your goals. He wants you to be independent, productive man for him to bless you with his heritage.
