<h1>introduction</h1>
<p>Hello, I am <strong>Osubula Brian </strong>The unplugeed Father.<br>
  The Guide On How To Understand The Cold, Hard Truth About Man's life, Self-Care, Money, 
  Intersexual Power Dynamics and The Modern World We Live In.<br> 
  
  I Also Dedicate It To All The Men That Never Had a Strong, Masculine Male Role Model While Growing Up 
  To Teach them About What They Might Expect
   In The World We Live In and How To Deal With It.</p>

<p>What I am going to write or talk are practical experiences for overcoming Emasculation in men. 
-and what I will write are painful, sour even taught because they are pulling you out of brainwashing.<br>

If you are feminist, you won't like what I write, You don't want to hear it because I will ruffle your Fragile egos. 
You will mock or joke or ignore when I say things especially fixing your <strong>Frame</strong> as a man. 
You will call me 'a biter man' or a 'man who lucks sex' or a 'man who hates women' and
the thing I will say are foolish and misogynistic.</p>

<p> I am therefore here to talk with you and help you become the best version of yourself. 
I will not say what you want to hear, 
I will not say what will make you laugh, 
I will not say what will keep you in your comfort zone.

I will say what is hard, 
I will say what you refuse to listen to, 
I will say what the system does not want to tell you, 
If you are fat, I will tell you outright that you are fat,
If you are addicted to masturbation, I will tell you openly to stop it, 
I don't care about feelings because feelings are for weak men.</p>  

<p> The world does not care about your so-called feelings.
The world has two types of Fathers, The one Who is giving you solutions to your problems. 
Or  The one who is creating content for entertainment. 
The choice is always yours, not mine.<br> I am not a content creator or an entertainer, 
I am a teacher who is going to teach you to be a better man not a bitter man. 

I don't entertain. I tell you to be a good person. I tell you to be a productive. 
I Bait  your egos, trigger your emotions and anger. Drill and stir your comfort. 
I will Force you to think,  Give you a solution. </p> 

<p> The solution always requires discipline, sacrifice and commitment. 
You either agree with me and evaluate yourself and execute it or you will vanish into your mediocrity. 

I don't just narrow myself to the gender interrelations and power dynamics between men and women, 
I widen the scope to broaden your <strong>Frame</strong> and let you be a whole rounded man.</p>

<p><strong>Where do I get all these?</strong><br>
From my experiences and other people’s experiences.
From stories I encounter.
From my grandparents.
From wisdom and wisdom from ancestors. 
From the books I read. I learnt from book experiences.</p>
