<h1>Divorce and break-up</h1>

<img src="photo/MEAL/divorce-.jpg">

<p>   The <strong>'Divorce Machine'</strong> is a relentless grinder that does not care about you as a man, 
and your rights as a father. </p>

<p>  The entire point of becoming a father, passing on your <strong>DNA,</strong> 
and name can be stripped from you by the state.</p> 

<p>   Men need to take a very calculated, and careful approach to untying the knot if they don't want 
to get <strong>destroyed by family law,</strong> and get alienated from their kids.</p>  

<p>  The <strong>divorce process is painful</strong>, often lengthy, with no support networks, 
and often most of your family or friends have no idea what you are going. </p>

<p>  Most men just sleep walk through this process, and get <strong>destroyed</strong>.</p>  

<p>  The problem with divorce is family law tendes to encourages women to behave 
very <strong>badly</strong> during the process and rewards her 
richly for becoming the <strong>custodial</strong> parent.</p> 

<p>  She can make unilateral decisions without the fathers consent, and most dads see their wealth 
flow to his children's mother, while she alienates him from his own children.</p>  

<p>  Without a shared parenting plan, it's not uncommon for fathers to see their ex wife move
 4,000 miles across the country with his kids, 
 hyphenate or change their last names,perform medical or hormone treatment without your consent or worse. </p> 


<p><strong>   Divorce for men is brutal.</strong></p> 

<p> You've probably heard the sayings:</p> 

<p>  <strong>"The woman you marry, is never the same woman you divorce" </p>

<p>  or "You never 
know a woman until you meet her in court"</p>

<p> -and "The reason why divorce is expensive, is because it's worth it."</strong></p> 

<p>   It often ends in her taking away your kids.. And if you do get to see them you’ll have to pay through 
the nose for every minute with them. </p> 

<p>  You’ll then be <strong>stripped of your rights as a father</strong>, having no say over them.</p>

<p>  She can take most of your <strong>resources,</strong> including your <strong>retirement.</strong>
Some men have even had to pay HER legal fees. </p>

<p>  And if you push back and fight her on this?<br> 
She can lie and say you’re <strong>abusive</strong> and the judge will give her what she wants.</p>

<p>  Men rarely have <strong> a "clean" divorce.</strong> It’s no secret family law favors the woman.</p> 

<p> A man needs to navigate through <strong>divorce very carefully</strong> or he could <strong>lose everything.</strong></p>

<p>  Divorce is not the time to be <strong>a "nice guy" or chivalrous.</strong></p>

<p>  You must protect yourself.</p>

<p>  The decisions you make during your divorce will <strong>impact your life forever.</strong>
So you must go into it with a plan.</p>

<p> There are  Thing you need to know about getting through a divorce.
Things like:</p>

<strong>
What to do when she lies about domestic violence.<br>
•	How to keep custody of your kids.<br>
•	How to protect your assets.<br>
•	What to do if she tries to alienate you from your kids.<br>
•	How to deal with acrimony.</strong></p>


<p>  If you go into a divorce without the <strong>right information?</strong> She will take you to the cleaners.</p>

<p>  Do yourself a favor and protect your rights as a man and as a father. </p>

<p><strong>Relationships are often temporary.</strong></p>

<p>  The truth is humans aren’t lifelong monogamous pair bonders.
It’s been that way since the dawn of time, even when monogamy is enforced.</p>

<p>  Women have always <strong>betrayed</strong> and they always will.</p>

<p>  When a woman says <strong>"I love you",</strong> It means she loves you right now.</p>

<p>  That goes for any feeling she has towards you - it’s in THAT moment she says it.</p>

<p> When you understand <strong>female nature</strong> it can soften the blow of <strong>betrayal.</strong> </p> 

<p> But it isn’t a cure for having your <strong>heart broken</strong> 
or having <strong>an unhealthy attachment</strong>  to a woman. </p>  

<p>   It’s still probably going to happen at some point even if you are <strong>red-pilled and unplugged man.</strong></p> 

<p>  Men have always struggled more <strong>with attachment.</strong></p>

Women on the other hand are expert <strong>mate-switchers.</strong></p>

<p> Many studies have shown how adept women are at <strong>mate-switching</strong>.</p> 
<p> Men haven’t evolved as well to deal with that.</p>

<p>  The truth is, a woman probably will <strong>betray</strong> you at some point.</p> 

<p> It might not happen. But the only way through that is just to deal with it.
<strong>Female nature is what it is.</strong></p>

<p>  She isn’t sugar and spice and all things nice.</p> 

<p> As a man you have to understand womens nature, 
set your feelings aside and deal with it.</p> 

<p> If you’d like to better prepare yourself for dealing with <strong>female nature.</strong></p>



<h1>break-ups</h1>

<p>  Do not be concerned with living a single life. </p>

<p> Do not be pushed to marry, especially a bad woman. </p>

<p> You will be killed and the world won't be bothered 
because the standard of justice for women is lower and skewed.</p> 

<p> What a man needs is FREEDOM and PEACE to pursue his PURPOSE.</p>

<p> If a woman is not giving you FREEDOM and PEACE, just abandon that relationship right away.</p> 

<p> DO NOT get stuck in a bad relationship.</p>

<p> Get out of that stagnation, go start a new life. </p>

<p> A man can recreate himself into the best man.</p> 

<p> "What about my children?" </p>

<p> Children will grow.</p>

<p> What if you die?</p>

<p> The children will die too? </p>

<p> Erase this mindset of "what about my children?"</p> 

<p> and get out of a toxic relationship. </p>

<p>You can take care of them from a distance.</p>

<p> If you love your children, get out of a toxic relationship,</p>

<p> Because children who grow in toxic environments end up being broken, 
fragile and resentful adults.</p>

<p> You will be killed. We will bury you.</p>

<p> Your woman will go to jail, come out and date another man.</p>






<p><strong>Listen</strong><br>

You can have a sane marriage, You are hardworking, with happy children,

Then, one day, your wife starts <strong>misbehaving.</strong></p>

<p> Don't panic and a fight.  Remain calm. Control your emotions.</p>

<p>  Once you notice <strong>bad manners </strong>in your woman,
it is time to fortify your <strong>boundaries.</strong></p>

<p> If you <strong>interrogate her about her change in manners</strong> but she becomes chaotic,
It is time to focus on your <strong>dream</strong> like never before.</p>


<p> She has been getting advice from her miserable, unmarried friends.</p>

<p> A man does not walk out of marriage. <strong>He ENDS it</strong></p>

<p> It is women who walk out of it</p>

<p> Marriage belongs to a man.</p>

<p> Therefore, <strong>Don't sit in a bad marriage. </strong>
It is a waste of time to rehabilitate <strong>a dying marriage.</strong></p>

<p> Let it die a natural death.</p>


<p><strong>On children,</strong></p>
<p> and if the <strong> marriage ends,</strong> and she attaches your payslip to child support,</p>

<p> Again, Don't panic. Don't be depressed.</p>

<p> Don't fight back. You will lose.</p>

<p>   Take it as a wake-up call to <strong>build other streams of income.</strong></p>

<p>   Just Seek access to your children.</p>

<p>   If the mother denies, don't fight.</p>

<p>   <strong>Custodial</strong> fights are messy & will damage your children.</p>

 <p>   Let her remain with them, they will look for you in the future.</p>



<p><strong>Also,</strong><br>

Do not start another relationship immediately.</p>

<p> Take your time. Embody the lessons from the previous one.</p>

<p>  Continue <strong>fixing your frame.</strong> Embrace your singularity and semen retention.

Focus on your <strong>dream.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Remember,</strong><br>

A woman is not your <strong>relative and women betray.</strong></p>

<p> She is <strong>a stranger</strong> you met in your adulthood.</p>

<p>  Maybe you took her to college or bought her an asset.</p>

<p>  If she <strong>betrays</strong> you, take it as a lesson of life.</p>

<p>  Let go, and let God. You have <strong>a dream.</strong></p>

<p>  Therefore, Once she <strong>betrays </strong>you, Don't seek revenge.</p>

<p>  The judiciary is gynocentric. it is about a women and children not about a man.</p>

<p>  It will frustrate & persecute you.</p> 


<p>  Vengeance is for the Lord. Leave it to him.</p> 


<p>  Your revenge is to <strong>focus on your dream & become successfully</strong> </p> 


<p>  Once a woman <strong> betrays</strong> you, Don't sulk.</p>

<p>   Don't be depressed. Accept it.</p>

<p>  The silent tears that drop in your heart will stand with you.</p>

<p>  Focus on your <strong>craft, skill or work.</strong></p>

    <p>  She expects you to <strong>fail.</strong> Refuse to <strong>fail.</strong></p>


 
    <p><strong>LAW 2: Never trust her, learn to use her enemies</strong></p>
    
    <p> She is not your <strong>relative.</strong> She will <strong>betray</strong> you at your lowest.</p>
    
    <p>     Being honest with her all the time and sharing your <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> will land you in trouble.</p>
    
          <p>  Her enemies will reveal to you her plans.</p>
    
       <p><strong>You see,</strong><br>
       When a woman becomes <strong>comfortable</strong> in a relationship.</p> 
          
       <p>    She begins thinking she can leave for a better one.</p> 
          
       <p>    She begins demeaning you & mocking your efforts, and dream.</p> 
          
       <p>     Don't cling on her, She wants to betray you. Let her go.</p>
