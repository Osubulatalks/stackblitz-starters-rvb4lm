<h1>Red flags in the gym</h1>

<p> If you are just about to join a gym or a new member of a gym, </p>

<p> Don't ignore these red flags. </p>

<p><strong>1. A thin or fat gym trainer</strong></p>

<p> A gym trainer should be lean with clear muscle contour. </p>

<p> This shows his consistency and discipline in the gym. </p>

<p> A thin or fat gym trainer is a joker, a loser and a hoodrat.  </p>

<p> Avoid him or avoid that gym. </p>

<p> <p><strong>2. An illiterate Gym trainer</strong></p>

<p> If a gym trainer in your gym doesn't understand anything about: </p>

<p><strong>• Anatomy of the muscles. </strong></p>

<p><strong>• Where muscles originate and insert.</strong></p>

<p><strong>• The nerve innervation on muscles.</strong></p>

<p><strong>• Physiology of metabolism.</strong></p>

<p><strong>• Nutrition and Biochemistry.</strong></p>

<p> Then it is a red flag. </p>

<p> Such a trainer will instruct you to do unnatural workouts that will impinge and injure your muscles, 
tendons and joints. </p>

<p><strong>3. Lack of a gym plan</strong></p>

<p> If a gym has no routine, no plan and no order, then it is a gym that lacks discipline. </p>

<p> You will not experience progress. </p>

<p> It is a gym where the trainers instruct trainees based on moods and feelings. </p>

<p> They don't know what you want, and what is your goal, 
therefore today they will be shuffling you from one station to the other, 
then tomorrow they will be telling you to jump aerobics. </p>

<p> They will also be advising you to eat a heavy breakfast, 
3 bananas and 6 meals a day to gain muscle! </p>

<p> That is a red flag. </p>

<p><strong>Other red flags are:</strong></p>

<p> A gym that plays soy music and low vibration music eg RnBs. </p>

<p> A gym that has a fridge stocked with energy drinks and sodas. </p>

<p> A gym that sells you protein and steroid powders. </p>

<p> A gym where members don't rack back the weights. </p>

<p> A dirty gym with strewn equipment all over the place. </p>

<p> A gym where trainers and trainees spend time gossiping. </p>

<p> A gym filled with noisy and skimpy women. </p>

<strong>Remember, </strong><br>

<p> A gym is a man's temple. </p>

<p>  It is where you go to have communion with yourself. </p>

<p>  A gym that doesn't give you space and peace of mind is a bad gym. </p>


<h1>Still in the gym,</h1>

<p><strong>Here are essential principles that will sustain you in the gym:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Have Goals</strong></p>

<p> What is your goal? </p>

<p>  Why do you go to the gym? </p> 

<p> ost people go to the gym without a reason.  </p>

<p> This leads to laziness and procrastination. </p>

<p> But if you have a goal, you will focus on achieving it. </p>

<p> A goal can be, </p>

<p> - To lose weight by XY kgs. </p>

<p> - To get stronger by lifting XY kgs. </p>

<p> - To add XY kgs of muscle. </p>

<p> - To improve my pull-ups by XY reps and sets. </p>

<p><strong>2. A workout Plan</strong></p>

<p>  Once you establish your goal,</p>

<p> sit down and create a workout plan that you will execute to achieve your goals.</p>

<p> A workout plan should be simple and enhance consistency.</p>

<p> Don't choose a complex plan.</p>

<p> Don't expect quick results. What matters is the persistence of your hunger and determination.</p>

<p><strong>3. Compounding</strong></p>

<p>This principle applies to your daily progressive effort.</p> 

<p> It means adding the load and work at every session.</p> 

<p> This is achieved by progressive overload.</p> 

<p> For example,<br>

If your squat was 20 kgs on day 1, it should have been compounded to 60 kgs on day 90.</p> 

<p><strong>4. Modality of Fitness Training </strong></p>

<p>  Choose a model that fits your fitness goals.</p>

<p> A model could be HIITs, Functional workouts, Isolation workouts, or a Hybrid system.</p>

<p> A functional model, also known as a compound workout style.</p>

<p> compound workouts is what I recommend for most workouts because it involves multi-articular activity. </p>

<p> It targets more muscles and makes you stronger in the gym.</p>

<p><strong>5. Predictability</strong></p>

<p>  Have a predictable road map. Stick to one plan for at least one year.</p> 

<p> Let the workouts be ingrained in your mind.</p>

<p> You can quickly know which workouts you will do on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday.</p>

<p> When you wake up before stepping into the gym, you should be aware of the workouts, 

the reps and the sets you will do.</p>

<p><strong>6. Measurements</strong></p>

<p> Have a monitoring and an evaluation metric. </p>

<p> Establish a tool that you will use to track your progress.</p>

<p> This will help you to remain focused on the journey.</p>

<p> Measurements will also tell you if you are achieving your goals or not.</p>

<p><strong>7. Rest</strong></p>

<p> You are a human being, not a machine.</p>

<p> Learn to take rests between sessions.</p>

<p> Men above 35 can go to the gym thrice a week,</p>

<p> While those below 35 can go 4 to 5 times a week.</p>

<p> Resting between session days allows the body to undergo healing and recomposition.</p>


<p><strong>7. Mentors and Peers</strong></p>

<p> Join a team of like-minded people who will force you to be accountable.</p> 

<p> Surround yourself with the right influence and support system.</p>

<p> They will correct your flaws and guide you.</p>

<p> They will call you out when you begin showing weakness and celebrate when you achieve your goals.</p>

<p> Join a peer support group.</p>
