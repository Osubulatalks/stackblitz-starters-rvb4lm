<h1>THE HIERARCHY OF MARRIAGE:</h1>

<p><strong>THE HIERARCHY OF MARRIAGE: </strong></p>


<p> Once you bring a woman into your relationship,

She must surrender her independence to you.</p> 

<p>  She is now yours. You only provide if she surrenders her independence.</p>

<p>  But if she hangs on her independence and wants freedom to do what pleases her,
Then don't provide and don't continue with the relationship.</p> 

<p>  A man only provides on condition that the woman is worth the providence.</p> 

<h1>The Hierarchy of Relationships:  </h1> 

<p><strong>  God is supreme,<br>

Under him, is Man,<br>

Under man, is woman,<br>

Under woman, are children.</strong></p>

<p> A man gets God's blessings ONLY if he submits to God.</p>  

<p>  Similarly, a woman ONLY gets a man's attention if she submits to the man.</p>

<p> Children can only eat food, dress well, and go to school if they submit to the mother.</p> 

<p>  The mother presents the children's requests to their father, and the father provides for them.</p>

<p>  The father presents the family's requests to God, and God blesses the family.</p>

<p> This is the natural order of relationships.</p>

That's how nature has built it. That's the <strong>hierarchy.</strong> </p> 

<p> The modern world attempts to usurp this order, and it has led to chaos.</p> 


<p><strong>  A  woman can't love a man.</strong></p>
<p><strong> It is a man who loves a woman.</strong></p>

<p> Love is a top-down action.</p> 
<p>  It is God who loves man, but man can't love God.</p>

<p> Therefore, man must obey, submit, and respect God to be loved.</p> 

<p> Similarly, a woman must obey, submit, and respect her man to be loved.</p> 

<p> Also, a woman can only love children, but children can't love the mother. </p>

<p>Therefore, children must obey, respect, and submit to the mother to be loved.</p>

<p>However, a man doesn't show love through emotions.</p>

<p>He shows it through actions known as the <strong>4Ps</strong></p>

<p><strong>• Precede<br>
• Provide<br>

• Protect<br>
• Penetrate</strong></p> 

<p>  So, if the woman becomes rude, belligerent, and bellicose, she doesn't deserve to be loved.</p>

<p>  She doesn't deserve to be preceded, provided for, protected, or penetrated.</p>

<p>  She deserves to be abandoned to suffer the pain of her ignorance.</p>

<p>  Men who think women can love them are the men who cry when dumped by women.</p>

<p>  They are the ticks who hang on women for affection.</p>

<p>  These are men who think a wife is a partner and also think there is equality in a relationship.</p>



<p> So the work of man is to create nature that the mother and children will flourish.</p>

<p>You work as a man is to build a natural environment for your children to flourish but you love their mother.</p> 

<p>That's why in a family. We say, man, is the priest of the family. 
Woman cannot be a priest of the family. </p> 

<p><strong> Why is the man a priest of the family? </strong></p>

<p> Because he talks directly to God, there is a verse in the Bible for Christians, 
which says, a man's prayer is more powerful than a woman's prayer.</p> 

<p>A father is the leader in that family. </p> 

<p>He provides structures and laws in which a mother and the children are supposed to confine themselves within,</p> 

<p>-and mother empathizes and ensures that these order is a feared to a nobody goes against the orders.</p> 
<p>A mother will always have referral incase children misbehave. </p>

<p> A mother will always remind children,  if they don't do this and that, 
a father will punish them. - and children recognize a father's authority. </p>

<p> A mother who is always yelling at her children,
— Or abandons children to go drink.</p>


<p>Or is on social media seeking men's attention,
Is lonely, desperate and disturbed.</p>

<p>  Modern men today worship their wives & adore their children, that's why children & mother 
disrespectful and mannerless.</p>



<p><strong>  Here is the point:</strong></p>

<p>  Love is a verb from the ancient word Leubh which means "care for."</p>

<p> Love is an action, not an infatuation.</p>

<p> Therefore, since a woman cannot love a man,
It is natural for her to cry when the man stops loving her.</p>

<p> It is because she is scared that her future is uncertain,</p>

<p>  Her vulnerabilities are displayed and her insecurities exposed to danger.</p>

<p> But a man who cries because he was dumped by a woman is doing so,</p>

<p> Because he was never loved by his mother when he was a child. </p>

<p> His mother didn't love him because she was equally not loved by her husband.</p>
<p> Probably the man was absent, weak, effeminate or just an idiot.</p>

<p> When a mother is not loved, then she struggles to love her children.
— and then the children struggle with insufficiencies and spiritual anxiety.</p>

        <p> Also, a man who expects a woman to love him never saw his father loving his mother;</p>

            <p> Therefore, he doesn't understand the praxeology of the love hierarchy. </p>

                <p> There was no father to be his role model. 
                 — or if the father was alive, he was a weak father in the pants of the mother.</p>

                <p> This crying man, therefore, expects his woman to take care of him, provide for him, 
                    protect him, precede him and also give him unlimited free sex.</p>

                    <p> In return, he just sits like a loser, offering nothing but becoming 
another useless big baby in the life of the woman.</p>

<p> This then becomes a dystopian relationship, and women hate dystopia.</p>

<p> She will soon exit the dystopian relationship and leave the man throwing tantrums like a toddler.
</p>
<p> Women need to be taken care of and be loved.</p>

<p> Men want to be respected and obeyed.</p>

<p> Expecting a woman to love you is like expecting God to obey man.

That is dystopianism.</p>




<p><strong>Here is the point.</strong></p>

<p>  Men are inherently caring, philanthropic, and altruistic.</p>

<p> They are deeply disturbed when they see women and children suffering.</p>

<p> — Leave alone male politicians. These are simps and cucks.</p> 

<p> A man can stop in the streets and feed a beggar, but a woman cannot.</p>


<p>  A man can stupidly and ignorantly sacrifice to live an insufferable 
life with an unworthy woman because he is disturbed about the safety of the children and even the woman.</p>

<p> This is why women use manipulative tactics to disarm and emasculate the man because
they know men are naturally empathetic and compassionate. </p>

<p> A man may think twice before dumping a woman,</p>

<p> "What if she harms herself?"</p>

<p> "How can I do it in a way she won't cry?"</p>

<p><strong>But a woman cannot.</strong></p>

<p>  Once she confirms her option is secured, she quickly swings to the next branch without apology.</p>

<p> A woman can't be considerate about the future of the man whom she is dumping unless she has no option. </p>

<p> Or she is so valueless that she has nowhere to go.</p>

<p> Women don't think twice when dumping a weak man. This is because they can't love a man.
They only love children.</p>

<p> During a divorce, she hangs on the children and not on the man. </p>

<p> Because she only loves children. She is created to mother and nurture. 
She can't mother a man who sleeps with her.</p>

<p> A woman, therefore, can't love a man. She is living with the man on condition 
that she is emotionally secure because the Man <strong>Precedes, Protects, Provides and Penetrates.</strong> </p>

<p> She can only like the man because of the value the man is offering. Once the value dies,
she will create a dramatic reason to exit the relationship.</p>

<p> It is, therefore, the reason I say don't waste your time pleasing 
a woman and expecting her to reciprocate. That is not how women were created.</p>

<p> Women were created to be loved, and in return, they respect and obey.</p>

<p> — and love doesn't mean buying flowers, chocolates, and using her photo as your profile picture.
This is nonsense.</p>

<p> If she doesn't respect you, obey you but wants to be independent 
and to do what pleases her, then abandon her.Don't love her. </p>


<p> You are wasting your time. Leave her alone. She will stress you.</p>

<p> You will die of depression. Focus on yourself and your FRAME.</p>
