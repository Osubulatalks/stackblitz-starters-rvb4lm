<h1>Morning Breakfast</h1>
<p>The most meaningless meal of the day.</p>
<img src="photo/MEAL/break1.jpg">

<p>Eggs and bacon for morning breakfast were aggressively marketed by propagandist Edward Bernays on 
behalf of the food industry.</p>

<p>  There's nothing healthy or nutritious about a morning meal. In medieval Europe, 
eating early in the day was only a necessity for those who worked so early that they had to eat early, or for the elderly and the sick. 
</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas a 13th-century theologian believed that it was a sin to eat too early in the day. 
In the Roman religious tradition, eating before morning mass was unacceptable because fasting was 
a spiritual obligation and therefore breakfast literally meant breaking the fast.</p>


<p>  In Africa, until the mid-21st century, our grandparents never ate the morning meal.
I remember in the mid-80s and until the mid-90s, my grandparents woke up early in the morning, 
drank a tumbler of water and left for the farm. </p>

<p>  They would tender the crops while keeping a keen eye on the cows. 
Then they would leave the farm at 1 o'clock where my grandmother would go home to prepare 
lunch as my grandfather drove the animals to the river to drink water. 
They would then meet at 2 o'clock for their first meal of the day. 
</p>

<img src="photo/MEAL/break2.jpg">

<p>Morning breakfast is an alien dietary habit in the African culture.</p>

<p>  Similarly, as pupils in rural neighbourhoods, we never ate the morning meal. 
We just woke up, prepared ourselves and left for school while running 
lest we be punished by our teachers for lateness. 
At 1 o'clock we would trek back home to eat our first meal of the day. 
Suffice it to say, we were jovial, energetic, lean and healthy. </p> 


<p>   As people increasingly migrated from rural areas to urban areas to work for an employer, 
rather than working for themselves on their own land, they lost control of their time and had to work long, 
uninterrupted days without sustenance. They would therefore eat a huge morning meal that allowed them to work 
longer hours.</p> 

<p>  This Industrial Revolution and the move from farms to factories 
normalized the idea of a heavy morning meal before going to work or school.
<strong> "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day"</strong> was a marketing strategy created by Nestle, 
Kellogg and General mills to market their cereals eg Weetabix, Oats and bread. 
</p>

<h1>  Where did this concept of 'morning breakfast' come from?</h1>


<p> This concept was created by a businessman known as William Keith Kellogg with his brother,
a medical doctor, Dr John Harvey Kellogg. These two brothers were Adventists and took the 
advantage of an Adventist theorem of veganism to create a food production industry known as Kellogg's.
</p>

<img src="photo/MEAL/break3.jpg">

<p>Dr John Kellogg was an Adventist who invented breakfast cereals. 
Kellogg's food industry still exists and it is domiciled in Michigan, USA. </p>

<p>  John Kellogg and William Kellogg popularized morning breakfast to sell their cereals called 'corn flakes.' 
They got a breakthrough by brainwashing members of the SDA church and when they had collected enough revenue 
they built charity organizations which they deceptively used to push their agenda of morning breakfast.</p>


<p>   Using top-notch propaganda, Dr John Harvey Kellogg, being a medical doctor, 
convinced everyone that 'Breakfast was the most important meal of the day.'
However, to sound modest and not appear like a shrewd salesman for his cereals,
he added "but, breakfast should not be heavy, it should consist of 
light cereals because a heavy breakfast can spike your blood sugar levels."
</p>

<p>These two brothers captured research institutions.
They funded hospital activities.
They manipulated the media.
This is exactly how modern medicine has captured minds to sell its products. 
</p>
<img src="photo/MEAL/break4.jpg">

<p>Dr. John kellogg invented cornflakes as part of a puritan diet designed to suppress 
    sexual desire and lead people away from masturbation.</p>

  <p>  The Kellogs brothers were soon joined by another American cereals company known as
     General Mills which was founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
    </p>

    <p>General Mills was producing, marketing and selling cereals. 
        The idea of morning breakfast gave them leverage to sell their
         cereals with the tag 'morning breakfast is the most important meal of the day.'</p>


<p> These two treacherous companies were then also joined by another 
European company known as Nestlé which was founded by an American who was 
living in Switzerland. Nestle also specialised in morning breakfast meals 
but their interests were in condensed milk and infant formula feeds.</p> 
        
<p> Then there was another master of American propaganda known as Edward Bernays. 
Edward was Sigmund Freud's nephew who had mastered human behaviour. 
He took the morning breakfast campaign a notch higher by pushing for sausage and bacon on the morning table. </p>  
               

<p>  Edward Bernays: The father of modern Propaganda.
Edward Bernays convinced 5,000 doctors to promote bacon and eggs as a healthy breakfast. 
His agenda was to promote sales of bacon on behalf of a company known as Beech-Nut which is owned by Nestle.

<h1>   The Circadian Clock</h1> 
<p>The Circadian clock or rhythm is a 24-hour internal clock in our brain that 
regulates cycles of alertness and sleepiness by responding to light 
changes in our environment. 
</p>
<img src="photo/MEAL/break5.bmp">


<p>The circadian clock controls our sleep/wake cycle. It also regulates metabolism, immunity, fertility 
and other biological functions.</p>

<p>  Our physiology and behaviour are regulated by the Earth’s rotation around its axis. 
This biological circadian system has evolved to help mammals adapt to changes 
in the environment and anticipate changes in radiation, temperature, and food availability.</p>


<p>   One of the adaptations is the change in the internal activities at dawn just 
before sunrise. During this time the cock crows, the donkey brays and the birds 
chirping. Do you think these mammals have a timekeeper? Yes, the timekeeper is the circadian clock.
</p>

<p>Human beings have these changes too.</p>


<p> At 4 AM in the morning, the human body releases a thread of hormones
known as the counter-regulatory hormones. </p> 

<p>  These hormones are</p>

<ol>
<li> 	Glucagon</li>
<li> 	Adrenaline</li>
<li> 	Cortisol</li>
<li> 	Growth hormone</li>
</ol>

<p>These hormones raise blood sugar in the morning. They also raise blood pressure and pulse rate.
The rising blood glucose level prepares you to face the day.<br>
Growth hormone prepares your muscles for the day while adrenaline wakes up your mind to face the morning.
</p>

<img src="photo/MEAL/break6.jpg">

<p>The body has several regulatory mechanisms to replenish energy when needed.</p>

This rising blood glucose will remain till a few minutes after midday when it begins dropping. 
If it falls, the body will now use another mechanism to mobilize more glucose from muscle tissues and the liver, 
and this includes converting fats in the liver into glucose. This mechanism is known as Gluconeogenesis.</p>


<p> Therefore you don't have to eat anything in the morning because the body has 
already availed enough resources through the action of counter-regulatory hormones.


<strong> <p>  "But, we need energy..."</p></strong> 


<p>Energy does not come from the stomach. Energy does not come from the food you have just eaten. 
Energy comes from a complex process in the mitochondria known as the <strong>KREB CYCLE.</strong>
The entire process begins in the liver or skeletal muscles, not the stomach.</p>

<h1> THE KREBS CYCLE</h1>

<p> <strong> THE KREB CYCLE</strong> is a series of biochemical processes that happen inside the mitochondria. 
Fats, carbs and proteins are metabolized from the fat stores in the liver or muscles 
to release a special molecule known as ACETYL-COA. This molecule is fed into the <strong>KREB Cycle.</strong></p> 


<p> This molecule undergoes several biochemical steps inside the mitochondria to 
release a certain reducing agent called NADH. </p> 


<p> This NADH is fed in a respiratory channel inside the mitochondria in a process 
called oxidative phosphorylation where huge amounts of energy are produced 
in the form of a compound known as ATP. 
<strong> Energy comes from stored glucose known as glycogen in the liver & muscle tissues 
and stored fatty acids in the adipose tissues.</strong></p> 

<img src="photo/MEAL/break7.png">

<p>The Kreb cycle happens in the mitochondria. It's purpose is to release fuel for energy use.</p>


 <p> Therefore if there is low blood glucose and yet the body needs energy,
 the body can turn proteins into glucose in a process known as gluconeogenesis while 
 fats are converted into fuel called ketones in a process called Ketosis/ketogenesis.</p> 
    
    
  <p>  For a human body to get energy, it must harness acetyl-CoA from glucose or ketones. 
    It is therefore fallacious to think that energy comes from the food you have just eaten. 
    The food you have just eaten must undergo digestion and absorption then storage 
    before the body breaks the stored food into Acetyl-CoA.</p> 
    
    
<strong>  <p>  You would hear people say:</p>  
<p>  "I am tired, let me eat something to get energy."</p>
<p>   "I must eat breakfast to get energy"</p></strong>  
    
    
  <p>  This is misinformation and miseducation. 
    The small excitement you get after eating is due to dopamine thrills but not because of energy. </p> 
 <p> The body is not stupid. It has elaborate mechanisms to regulate its energy production.</p>

<img src="photo/MEAL/break8.jpg">

<p>Most people are not hungry. They eat because they cannot control their impulses since they are addicted to food.</p>

<p>  People, therefore, eat breakfast as a cultural fulfilment, not as a nutritional necessity.
 People nowadays eat food because they are addicted to food. 100% of the time they eat,
  they are not hungry but responding to their impulses.</p>  


<p>  What should people eat in the morning?</p> 


<p>  Since people are addicted to food, they, therefore, need a strategy that will suppress 
their morning impulses and cravings for food.</p> 


<p>  I recommend the following:</p>
<ul> 
<li> 	A cup of sugarless black coffee</li>
<li> 	A cup of sugarless black tea</li>
<li> 	A cup of sugarless Green tea</li>
<li> 	3 teaspoonfuls of Apple Cider Vinegar in a glass of warm water</li>
</ul>
</p>

<img src="photo/MEAL/break9.jpg">

<p>Black coffee in the morning: Drives away cravings and unnecessary impulses.</p>

<p>    Or, you can just be like my grandparents. Drink a tumbler of water and go.
Is breakfast the most important meal of the day? No, it is not.</p>


<p>   <strong>Which is the most important meal of the day?</strong> </p>

<p>The meal we eat between 2 pm and 7 pm. The One Meal A Day. OMAD.<br>
<strong> Our food should be our medicine and our medicine should be our food. - Hippocrates</strong>
