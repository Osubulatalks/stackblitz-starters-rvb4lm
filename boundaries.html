<h1> MASCULINE BOUNDARIES </h1> 

<p> Lack of masculine boundaries is the reason why many men live in chaotic marriages/Relationships.</p>   

<p> When they begin courting a woman, they blindly and ignorantly believe in her innocence and naivety. </p>   

<p> They then allow the woman to build her own boundaries which the man falls into.</p>   

<p> This man thereafter in his ignorance lives by his woman's standards.</p>    

<p> He lacks mission and values therefore he is led by his woman's values, ideas and thoughts.</p>   

<p>  He worships the woman religiously, believes in what she tells him and spends his time pedestalizing 
his woman's mission while forgetting his mission.</p>   


<p>  A man without a masculine boundary is a blind man.</p>     

<p> He is like a rangale of terrified deer tottering in front of a car's headlights.</p>   

<p> In the earnest of time, the woman will inevitably become resentful,</p>   

<p>  -and begin seeking newer and better thrilling  emotional entertainment 
from a man who has his boundaries well grounded.</p>   

<p> She will start cheating.</p>   

<p>  The marriage will become chaotic and hostile but since the man is still thriving in 
his effeminate ignorance he blames everybody else except him.</p>   

<p>  He set a bad tone at the beginning of the marriage and he is now reaping the dividends of his weakness.</p>    

<p> A weak man without boundaries in his relationship  cries when his woman dumps him.</p>   

<p> He will say things like:</p>   

<p><strong>  "I have done everything for you."<br>

"You were my everything."<br>

"I have invested in you."</strong></p>   

<p>  Listen,<br>

Women do not want you to make them the centre of your life,
Even though they may appear to beg you to make them your centre of everything.</p>

<p> She hates it.</p>   

<p> Your woman/girlfriend you to build a strong masculine boundary.</p>   

<p> She wants you to say NO.</p>   

<p> She wants you to upset her.</p>   

<p> She wants you to calm her feminine anxiety but not to enable them.</p>   

<p> She wants you to thrive in your singularity.</p>   

<p> She wants you to focus on your mission.</p>   

<p> Once you abandon your goals and start focusing on her,</p>   

<p> She will abandon you and start focusing on the man who is focusing on his goals.</p>   

<p> You can only focus on your goals if you have strong boundaries.</p>   


<p> Strong boundaries are made from your self-identity.</p>   

<p> Self-identity is made from the connection with your father.</p>    

<p> Fatherless men do not have boundaries. Or do not know how to build boundaries.</p>   

<p> That is why they abuse men the age of their fathers.</p>   

<p> That is why when they get rejected by a women they throw tantrums, therefore they fear rejection.</p>   

<p> That is why women misuse them because they fear upsetting women.</p>   


<p> Men without boundaries in their relationships,</p>   

<p> They fear upsetting women because they think all women are like their mothers who will pamper them.</p>   

<p> Therefore boundaries are masculine.</p>   

<p> Only a masculine man can build a boundary and stand firm on his boundary.</p>   

<p> Weak men lack boundaries, that is why women despise them.</p>   

<p> Build a strong boundary.</p>   

<p> Enclose it with masculine values.</p>   

<p> Embellish it with discipline and order.</p>   

<p> Guard your boundary.</p>   


<h1>Here is the point;</h1>

<P> It doesn't matter how many years you have been married,</P> 

<p>  The moment you lower your standards and lose your frame to your woman, it is game over!</P> 

<p>  Most of the 50+ years men you see out there, are in hostile marriages,</P> 

<p>  But they lack the courage to break free.</P> 

    <p>  If you refuse to enforce boundaries & be ruthless at it,</P> 

        <p>  She'll keep testing your frame until she conquers it.</P> 

            <p>  A woman can't just wake up to slap you.</P> 

                <p>  It is a behaviour you permitted. Guard your frame.</P> 

                    <p>  Ever wondered why some married men act subdued and quiet when in the presence of his woman?</P> 

                        <p>  Because marriage provides a fertile ground for weakening of a manâ€™s energy.</P> 

                            <p>  Before you marry, set boundaries* and enforce them.</P>  

                                <p>  Be firm. No SIMPING.</P> 

                                    <p><strong> Listen,</strong>  <br>

The moment you start dating, strictly enforce the boundaries.</P>  

<p>  Otherwise you will become useless in your own marriage.</P> 

<p>  Being in a relationship is being in a war.</P> 

<p>  Because there are competing interests.</P> 

    <p>  The man is tirelessly chasing his dreams,</P> 

        <p>  The woman is milking value from her man's dreams.</P> 

            <p>  As a man, define your dreams, and enforce boundaries on the first date.</P> 

                <p>  When you see a woman shouting or being rude to her man,</P> 

                    <p>  It didn't begin today.</P> 

                        <p>  He allowed the woman to push his boundaries inch by inch,</P> 

                            <p>  Women are creatures of patterns,</P> 

                                <p>  If you tolerate bad manners, they get more disrespectful.</P> 


                                    <p>   Therefore, the moment you start living together,

                                        <p>       Set your boundaries.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>     Don't do feminine house duties in the name of 'romance',</p>
                                    
                                        <p>    You are setting up yourself for failure.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>    No sharing duties. Let her do her role (nurturing), 
                                    while you do your role (building).</p>

                                    <p>    Do not sit down to discuss anything with her.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>    Draw your boundaries and enforce them.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>   She should either follow or bang the door.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>   The problem nowadays is that there are so many effeminate 
                                    men who think marriage is a showbiz. Marriage is war.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>  You either win or be defeated.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <p>  If you continue allowing your wife to encroach your boundaries,
                                     - in the name of "I love her",</p>
                                    
                                     <p>   She will embarrass you in public and you will be 
                                    doing the firefighting alone. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>  It is either your way or the highway.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>  Be Decisive. Firm.
                                    
                                    Unapologetic & Ruthless</p>
                                    
                                    <p>   Enforce your boundaries,</p>
                                    
                                    <p>  Never be permissible to contempt & disrespect,</p>

     <h1>    Take control of your relationship or marriage.</h1> 

   <p>   Take charge. Be the boss. </p>  
                                    
   <p>   Close all loopholes and enforce boundaries. </p>  
                                    
   <p>   Own the relationship. It is yours. </p>   
                                    
   <p>  Never allow your woman to lead the relationship. </p>  
                                    
   <p>   Because, SHE IS NOT YOUR RELATIVE. </p>  
                                    
   <p>    Being tough in marriage doesn't mean being cruel, </p>  
                                    
   <p>    It means:<br>
                                    
    <p>  Being strict with your goals and purpose, </p>  
                                    
    <p>    Being firm with your boundaries, </p>  
                                    
    <p>   Giving sane instructions, </p>  
                                    
    <p>    Beating your wife, mistreating her or being violent is not being tough. </p>                                          

    <p>    Even as you treat her like your queen in your kingdom,</p>  


    <p>    Remember,<br>
    
    Don't go beyond the boundaries of LEADERSHIP.</p>  
    
    <p>   Withdraw praises and attention if she shows misbehaviour and bad manners.</p>  
    
    <p>    Reprimand and censure.</p>   
    
    <p>    The right woman will appreciate. </p>  
    
    <p>     Remember you are the KING.</p>  
    
    <p>   Dictate the pace of the relationship from the first date.</p>  
    
    <p>    Occupy the pole position and enforce boundaries.</p>  
    
    <p>    If she outsmarts you, sorry!</p>  
    
    <p>    She will shred you into pieces and dump you!</p>
