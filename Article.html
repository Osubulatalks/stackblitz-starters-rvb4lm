      <h1>MASCULINITY</h1>

      <p>
        The term <strong>Masculinity</strong> refers to the roles, behaviors and
        attributes that are considered appropriate for boys and men in a given
        society.

        <strong>Masculinity</strong> is constructed and defined socially,
        historically and politically, rather than being biologically driven. We
        can think of <strong>Masculinity</strong> as a shorthand for talking
        about the social expectations and practices of manhood; expectations and
        practices which are reinforced everyday by individuals as well as by
        institutions, such as the law, the economy, religion, education and the
        media.
      </p>
      <p>
        Women as well as men are involved in reinforcing these social
        expectations of <strong>Masculinity</strong> (e.g. when a mother tells
        her son to act like a man and not to cry.) Therefore,
        <strong>Masculinity</strong> is social expectations of being a man.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Sex is biological:</strong> From the moment we are born, we are
        learning about both sex and gender. At birth, we are assigned a sex,
        either female or male, based on our biological characteristics (
        internal/external sex organs, chromosome and hormonal profiles). This
        division of people into either male or female does not recognize
        intersex people (those whose biological makeup includes both male and
        female characteristics).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Gender is social:</strong> On the basis of assigned sex
        (male/female), we grow up learning about the meanings and inequalities
        associated with this male/female difference. The term
        <strong>‘gender’</strong> refers to these social expectations that are
        associated with being male or female.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout childhood we are taught, in direct and indirect ways, about
        the roles, behaviors and attributes that are considered appropriate to
        being a man/boy and those that are appropriate to being a woman/girl.
        One of the first things we learn is the idea of gender difference; the
        difference between being a woman or man, or being a girl or boy.
      </p>

      <p>
        We see gender differences all around us: in the different games that
        boys and girls are allowed and encouraged to play; the different
        opportunities that young women and young men may have in life; the
        different work that women and men often do both inside and outside the
        home; and the different rights that men and women may enjoy. Gender
        difference is taught and reinforced continually - within our families,
        friendships and relationships, as well as our schools, workplaces and
        places of worship. Gender differences are also often gender hierarchies;
        in most societies, men on average have greater status, opportunities and
        rights compared to women.
      </p>

      <h1>FEMININITY</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Femininity</strong> is social expectations of being a woman: By
        the same token, the term <strong>‘femininity’</strong> refers to a
        society’s ideas about the roles, behaviors and attributes considered
        appropriate for girls and women.
      </p>

      <h1>HIERARCHY OF MASCULINITY OVER FEMININITY:</h1>
      <p>
        In all societies, there are many ideas about
        <strong> masculinity</strong> and <strong>femininity</strong> that are
        harmful to girls and women, and to boys and men. Research suggests that
        in most societies ideas about <strong>masculinity</strong> are defined
        in opposition to ideas about <strong> femininity.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The roles, behaviors and attributes that are considered appropriate for
        men are often defined as the opposite of those associated with
        femaleness and considered appropriate for women. More than this, the
        roles, behaviors and attributes that are associated with
        <strong>masculinity</strong> are usually considered superior to those
        associated with <strong>femininity</strong>; there is not only a
        difference between <strong>masculinity</strong> and
        <strong>femininity</strong> but also a hierarchy, in many aspects of
        life.
