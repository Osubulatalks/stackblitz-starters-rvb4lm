    <h1>Black tax</h1>

<p>The internet defines <strong>Black Tax</strong> as the financial burden borne by Black people who have achieved a level of success and who provide support to less financially secure family members. 
In families where there are no strong fathers, the children carry the burden of the family.</p>

<p>As Afrikans, we misuse the cordial relationship we enjoy as families. 
Family members can take advantage of your generosity to suck your resources and eventually leave you broke and depressed.</p>

<p>It is not bad to help struggling relatives.It is prudent to support our parents and siblings. - But this is dependent on your ability to carry the responsibilities. </p>

<p>Learn to say NO. Have boundaries and enforce them.
Demand for accountability of the money you are sending.</p> 

<p>Have a budget and stick to the budget. Prioritize your needs. Among your needs are your savings.<br> 30% of your earnings should be saved. 
Don't please relatives. Know when to stop entertaining them.</p>

<p>Have a clear financial  importance and urgency Matrix with your parents and siblings.</p>


<p>Tell your relatives to establish sustainable income-generating activities. You can support them to establish it and ask for accountability reports. 
If they mess it up, they should not come back to you.</p>
     
<h1>A word of advice to firstborns (or other children who have become the background of the family) </h1>

<p>Do not be blackmailed by your mother (or father) when it comes to money. 
Mothers have perfected the art of emotional manipulation in order to suck your value. </p>

<p>"You hate me yet I carried you for 9 months."
"Let me suffer. Let me know I do not have a child."
These tantrums are useless. They should not scare you. </p>

<p>She is your mother (or father), therefore respect her. But do not fall for her egotistical character. 
You are now an adult. You have your responsibilities. 
You have a budget. Follow your budget.</p>

<p>If in your budget you have set aside 5% of your monthly income for your parent, then stick to it. 
Do not accept to be drained. Remain firm and focused. </p>

<h1>On relatives, </h1>
<img src="photo/blacccck.jpg" >
<p>Most relatives never contributed anything on your path to success. 
Some mocked the poverty in your home. Some hoped you failed. </p>

<p>But relatives will be the ones demanding a share of your money with egotistical self-entitlement
as if the money belongs to them. </p>

<p>Even your parents don't claim a stake in your money with such obstinacy. 
"Please send me 100,000 urgently, your cousin will miss university exams." 
Relatives think you have a tree in your house where you pluck money. </p>

<p>Learn to tell your relatives, "I DO NOT HAVE MONEY." 
Remain firm. Remember if you become broke, your relatives will be the first to discuss you with their children; 
"Do not be like him. He wasted money on beer, cars and women."</p>

<h1>Still on relatives</h1>
<p>Everyone is a relative to someone or have relatives. 
But It is misanthropic to claim relatives are crucifying you on the cross of black tax while you are also the relative
misusing your relatives. </p>

<p>It is reckless to be self-entitled to your brothers or sisters or relatives or even your parent's money. 
"You hate me. You do not support me. I am suffering yet you have money." </p>

<p>Nobody owes you anything.They also have other responsibilities rather than pampering your ego.
Drag your ass out of the house and go find some work to do. </p>

<p>Stop bothering people and threatening to commit suicide because your relatives or siblings are not sending you money.
You are a bother and a burden, not just to them but to yourself.</p>
