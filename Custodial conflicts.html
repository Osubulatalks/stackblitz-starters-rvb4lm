<h1>Custodial conflicts</h1>

<img src="photo/ONE/1691103614571.png">

<p>If tell that once a marriage fails and a conflict emerges about the CUSTODY of CHILDREN,
You  the man must rise above the conflict and leave the children.</p>  

<p>You the clueless man will be saying,</p>  

<p><strong>  "I cannot leave my children"<br>
"I must fight for my children"</strong></p>  

<p>And I will conclude by saying, you are IGNORANT MAN who have never sat in marriage meetings.</p> 

<p>Your perspective of marriage is what they see on Netflix and what 
they hear from their single mothers.</p>

<p> Sit down with a man who has been through a tussle for children's custody, 
and he will bluntly tell you no to go that route. </p>

<p><strong>Listen</strong></p>

<p> The moment you start a quarrel about the children, you have already lost the war.</p>   

<p>   She has won all the battles and has finally won the war. There is nowhere you will win.</p>  

<p><strong>  Go to court, and you will lose.<br>
Go to church, and you will lose.<br>
Come to me, and you will lose.</strong></p>  


<p> <strong>Why are you losing? </strong>
Because you are bitter and angry.</p>

<p>  A bitter and angry man is an ugly man. Nobody wants to associate himself with such a man.</p> 

<p>  Listen once again, Detach your emotions from children.</p>  

<p>  They are your children. We all know it.
They know you are their father, so don't start behaving as if you are the mother.</p> 

<p>  Leave emotional attachment to the mother.
If she wants to remain with them, that is fine. Let her have them.</p> 


<p> What is the benefit of pulling your children through a useless traumatic 
experience in the name of legal fights? </p>  

If you are really concerned about your children, then avoid drama and chaos.
Let them not even know what is going on.  Just leave house in peace and play your part. </p> 

<p><strong>Listen to me</strong></p>

<p> If your neurotic woman bars you from accessing your child after a break-up,
Leave her alone. Don't go to court.</p>

<p>  legal battle will be messy, and it will affect the social development of the child.

If you like your child, do not drag your child to the corridors of justice.</p>

<p> The child will grow up with resentment and anxiety disorders. 
Your neurotic woman thrives in drama and chaos, don't give her that opportunity.</p>


<p> Starve her the attention that she is craving for. 
If you don't, she will blackmail you and drag you down the cesspit.</p>

<p> Remember, the justice system is gynocentric. It rewards women and punishes men.</p>

<p><strong>In case your baby mama adamantly escalates her demands and conditions for 
welfare of your child, Do the following:</strong></p>

<p> Open a bank account and give her ATM card.</p>
Deposit money monthly and put a caveat on it. </p>  
<p> Pay fees directly to the school. </p>  
<p>  Pay rent directly to the landlord. </p>   
<p> Identify the hospital or a clinic, pay direct to the doctor. </p>  
<p> Buy a file and keep a reciept of everything you buy or pay. </p>  

<p> Trust me on this.<br>
Children are not foolish. They see everything. They know what is going on.

In the fullness of time, they will look for you. </p>  

<p> But if you remain dramatic, chaotic, bitter and stupid, even your children will shun you.</p>


<p><strong>Remember,</strong></p>

<p>When a man abandons the mother of his children,

He is labeled a deadbeat .</p>

<p> But if a man stays with a toxic and unworthy woman out of love for his children,</p>

<p> You will not hear people appreciate him for his sacrifice to put up with a chaotic and disrespectful woman.</p>

<p> Truthfully, a man doesn't really abandon his children.</p> 

<p> He abandons a bad woman.</p>

<p><strong>Here is the thing;</strong></p>

<p>   You can only FATHER a woman and a child only if the  
environment is conducive for you to be a responsible FATHER.</p>


<p>  You can't be a responsible father where there is no authority.</p>

<p>  Where your wife has turned hostile against you.</p>

<p>  Neurotic women usually want a man to provide and be responsible but demean,
disrespect, and belittle the man.</p>

<p>  Then, once the man says "enough is enough" </p>

<p>     -and leaves to go start a new life elsewhere, 
the woman begins shaming the man and calling him "a deadbeat."</p>

<p>  Years later, when the woman fails to get another "responsible man" whom 
she thought would be better than the man she demeaned,</p>

<p> Then she begins sending abuses towards the man. — Father of her child.</p>

<p>  The truth is that,<br> No man wants to leave his child at the hands of 
another man, but women drive these men out of the child's life,</p>

<p>  Because they think the man is so desperately attached to the child that she can abuse, 
persecute, shame and frustrate the man. — and the man will do nothing.</p>

<p>  The story out in the public is always an accusation against the man, 
yet none sits to listen to the man’s story.</p>

<p>  If you are a man who is sent by choatic woman to go abuse another man, 
then you are a fool. An idiot. A cuck.</p>

<p>  Your day will also come, and you will want another man to listen to your story.</p>

<p> A woman's story is dramatic, emotional, faulty, and fraudulent.</p>

<p>  Always listen to the man first. His story is genuine.</p>


<p><strong>No FATHER is a "deadbeat"</strong></p>

<p> No FATHER will abandon his children for expediency.</p> 

<p> "Deadbeat" is a word used by chaotic women to shame MEN who refused to be manipulated.</p>

<p> They use babies as a source of income to fund their slut lives of  eating, alcohol and parties.</p> 

<p> It is about their self-interest and has nothing to do with the welfare of the baby.</p> 

<p> You will never hear a woman who sired with a poor man call him a "dead beat". In fact, she will protect him.</p>

<p> It is only a "deadbeat" if the MAN has social capital. </p>


<p> But if you observe keenly, there is a possibility the child does not belong to the "deadbeat" man.</p> 

<p> There is no FATHER who will willingly abandon his child.</p> 

<p> Unless, the FATHER has met a barrier, chaos and unfriendly demands from the woman 
Then, he will cunningly avoid further engagement with her and a child.</p> 

<p> The woman adamantly escalates her demands and conditions to the chagrin of the FATHER. </p>

<p> - And when the FATHER refuses to be manipulated, 
the woman throws tantrums, shames the man and provokes his spirit.</p>

<p> She blockades access, brainwashes the baby and poisons her close relatives 
and acquaintances to arm-twist their perception of the FATHER.</p>


<p> DON'T accept to be used. Demand access to the baby.</p> 

<p> If there will be no access, then there is no money from your pocket.</p>

<p> In this case, make sure the baby is your biological baby? </p>

<p>  Firmly If Yes, the baby is yours,<br>

Firmly demand accountability!  Never accept to be used. </p>

<p> Don't beg for access child. Don't be desperate for the child.</p>

<p> The more desperate you appear, the deeper she will dig.</p>

<p> You are also somebody's child. You deserve better.</p>



<H1>emotional attachment</H1>

<p> As a man refuse to attach yourself to things or people you value.</p>

<p><strong>  Your car, Laptop, Your child, Your house, Your parents .</strong></p>

<p> That attachment is dangerous. Showing affection is a weapon she will use to punish you.</p>

<p> She will Stone your car to trigger you emotions.</p>
<p> She will Break your laptop to hurt you.</p> 

<p> She will Run away with your child to make you follow her.</p>

<p> She will run to court to divid the house.</p>
<p> She will abuse and harass your parents hurt you. </p>
<p>Stay logical not emotional. Remain firm and STOIC in your rules and decisions.</p>

<p> Your emotions will destroy you.  Never show them infront of a women.</p>

<p>She is best at manipulation. Once she knows how you are triggered.That's it!</p>  

<p>She gonna make things worse. Stay calm, Don't react.</p>

If you feel like you want to cry, take those feelings to the GYM 
and lift weight of 100kg on squat x 10, you won't be the same. </p>

<p><strong>Emotional attachment to children</strong></p>

<p>  Detach emotions from your children,</p>
<p>  You are their FATHER, TEACHER & LEADER.</p>
<p>  Leave emotional attachment to their mother.</p>

<p>  Once your wife learns you are too emotionally attached to children , she will use them to manipulate you.</p>
