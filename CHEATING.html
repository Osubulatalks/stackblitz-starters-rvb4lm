<h1>CHEATING</h1>

<img src="photo/MEAL/CHEATING.webp">

<p> When it comes to a woman <strong>cheating, </strong> It’s better described as <strong>betrayal.</strong></p> 

<p>  Men <strong>cheat,</strong> but women <strong>betray. </strong></p>

<p>  If a woman sleeps with another man,
She has gone and allocated the love she had for you and given it to another dude.</p>

<p>No <strong>self-respecting</strong> man will tolerate this kind of behavior.</p>

<p>  When she <strong>cheats,</strong> she as becom <strong>a hoe </strong>(to put it plain and simple) 
she’s <strong>a hoe.</strong></p>

<p>  Or at some point you dropped the ball and stopped chasing <strong>excellence</strong> and started 
chasing for her <strong>desires</strong></p> 

<p> Women want to be with <strong>a giant.</strong> A guy that she can look up to.</p>

<p> If she has <strong>genuine burning desire</strong> for you, She is going to want to be in your world.
Eager to come home to you knowing that you’re the best man she can get.</p> 

<p> There are aspects a guy must take ownership for. </p> 

<p> But if she steps out of the relationship and <strong>cheats?</strong>
Regardless of what caused the <strong>cheating</strong> (her being <strong>a hoe </strong>or 
you not chasing <strong>excellence</strong> ). </p> 

You NEVER take her back. Only <strong>cucks </strong>do that.</p> 

<p>Too many guys try to fix a broken relationship. Even I have done it.</p> 

<p>  When you have given up your <strong>frame,</strong> it is almost impossible to get it back.</p>

<p>  When a woman loses <strong>attraction</strong> for you,
She No longer wants to <strong>sleep</strong> with you,</p> 

<p> She starts being <strong>disgusted</strong> by you,
She starts <strong>Disrespects</strong> you,
It is very difficult to turn that around.  </p>

<p> Remember, if a woman has <strong>contempt</strong> for you, she can't love you.</p>

<p>  Lots of <strong> "Nice" guys and pastors</strong> will tell you that you can fix it.</p>

<p>  That all you need to do is learn her "love language" or some bullshit like that.</p> 

<p> But 9 times out of 10 once she sees you as <strong>a Beta,</strong> 
She will always see you as <strong>a Beta.</strong></p>

<p>   You are much better off using that energy to build a new relationship 
rather than trying to fix an old broken one.</p>

<p> That way you can establish your <strong>frame</strong> at the beginning of the relationship.</p> 



<h1>Remember:</h1>

<p> Men do not <strong>cheat</strong> but spread their seeds for genetic survival. </p>

<p>  The word <strong>"cheat"</strong> is used by <strong>simps</strong> and women to guilt trip 
MEN into submission and make them docile. </p>

<p> As long as you have the <strong>resources,</strong> do not be afraid to marry another woman.</p>

<p> If you want to have a different pedigree of offspring from what you currently have, Go ahead.</p> 

<p>  A Man must see his DNA in his children. 
Don't be afraid to expand your breed. </p>


<p>  Also, As you approach more women, 

Always remember there is a difference between <strong>PLOGAMY and PROMISCUITY. </strong> </p>  

<p>  Do not have sex with women you don't intend to be committed to.  </p>  

<p>  Do not ejaculate in a woman you are ashamed to introduce in public.</p>



<p>Do not listen to <strong>modern effeminate pastors.</strong></p>


<p>  All the time, You will hear effeminate pastors while cherry-picking Bible verses say things like,<br>
<strong> </p> 

<p>  "A man should be faithful to his wife."<br>
" A man who cheats will go to hell."</strong></p>

<p>  Or you will hear resident TV and radio clowns who pretend to be relationship pundits say things like,
<strong> </p>

<p>"If you don't praise your wife, she will go to someone else,"</strong>
‐and a horde of other gynocentric bullshit.</p>

<p> <strong>Listen,</strong> <br>

A MAN is only <strong>faithful</strong> to himself and his mission/purpose. Full stop.</p>

<p> It is <strong>simps</strong> who are <strong>faithful</strong> to women.</p> 

<p>  It is women and ignorant men who expect men to be <strong>faithful</strong> to their wives.</p>

<p><strong>Faithfulness</strong> and fidelity in a man have nothing to do with his sexual relationships.</p>

<p> Factually, men don't cheat, they expand their territories, this is because a relationship belongs to a MAN.</p> 

<p>  He can add as many women as he wants into his territory as long as he has the capacity to take care of them. </p> 

<p>  <strong>"Cheating"</strong> is a femicentric siren crafted by women to guilt 
trip men from enjoying the exclusivity of dating.</p>

<p>  In a monogamous arrangement, it is the woman who wants to enjoy the exclusivity of sexual decisions. </p>

<p>Therefore, a man must only be <strong>faithful</strong> to himself and his mission. 
He should only praise and worship God.</p>

It is <strong>Simps and Average Frustrated Chumps (AFCs)</strong> who are <strong>"faithful"</strong> to their wives.<br>
Stop listening to TV clowns and betatized pastors. 
— and stop taking relationship advice from women. They know nothing about relationships.  </p>
