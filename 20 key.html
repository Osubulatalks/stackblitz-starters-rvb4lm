<img src="photo/ONE/too-much-weight.jpg">

<h1>20 KEY RESOLUTIONS FOR:</h1>

<p><strong> BEGINNER: 0 - 6 months. </strong> </p>

<p><strong>   MEDIATE: 6 months -1 YEAR. </strong> </p>

<p><strong> INTERMEDIATE: 1 year - 4 years. </strong> </p>


<p>    But mostly the <strong>BEGINNERS and MEDIATE.</strong></p> 

<p> <strong>  Here are 20 key things to remember:</strong></p> 

<p>    <strong> 1. First things first, you are not competing with anyone at the gym.</strong></p> 

<p>    You compete with yourself. </p> 

<p> <strong>    2. Always rest.  48 hours rest is important for your muscle health especially if you are;</strong>  </p> 

<p> 1.  Above 35 years,<br>
    2. Obese <br>
    3. Has a past injury<br>
    4. Skinny.</p> 

<p>     Any MAN below 30 years can have a 24 hours rest because 
their bodies have excellent AMINO acids metabolism.</p>  

<p> <strong>    3. Has a beginner, prioritized compound WORKOUTS.</strong>  </p>  

<p> 1.  Pullups 
2. Bench press<br> 
3. Deadlifts<br> 
4.  OVH shoulder press<br> 
5. Squats<br> 
6. Rows.</p> 

<p>   These are multi-articular WORKOUTS that target more MUSCLES at once resulting 
in effective MUSCLES growth outcome.</p> 

<p>   They will also build your STAMINA, ENDURANCE and you will not prone 
to silly injuries like having an ankle sprain after a silly slide.</p>  

<p> <strong>   4. Minimize isolation WORKOUTS. </strong>  </p>

<p>   "today I'm working on only arms." </p>

<p>    Leave those to GYM BROS who have been in GYM for more than 4 years and 
To PRO-ATHELETES who are now focusing on specific MUSCLES.</p>  

<p>   You may also have one or two as a supplementation WORKOUT to recruit specific MUSCLE FIBER.</p> 

<p>    E.g. Bishop curls,  skull crushers,  leg curls, unilateral raises.</p>  


<p>  <strong>    5. Have a timetable or a schedule.</strong>  </p>   

<p>  Don't go to the GYM without a plan.</p> 

<p>   You will end up doing what others are doing and this will mess your growth. </p> 

<p>    Ask your instructor GYM plan that you monitor and track your progress .</p> 

<p>  <strong>    6. The maximum time at the GYM is 40-60 minutes.</strong> </p> 

<p>   Beyond 1 hours is waste of time and waste of your MUSCLE growth.</p>  

<p>    If you don't WORKOUT with intensity in your 30 minutes of entering the GYM, 
forget taking 1 hours or 2 hours.</p>  

<p>    Leave long hours to BODYBUILDERS because they have enough ENDURANCE 
due to supplements like creatine and steroids.</p>  

<p>    Ever heard of phrase..."that man is on steroids or supplements...'?</p> 

<p>    So yeah! 40-60 minutes should be your maximum. Also giving space to other GYMS members.</p>  

<p>  <strong>   7. Progressive overload is important.</strong> </p>

<p>    If two weeks ago you were lifting 40kgs, this week you should be on 40kgs.
This shows growth. </p> 

<p>   Don't lift what you cannot lift. Ask for help. </p> 

<p>    If the body is unable, that's failure.</p> 

<p>    Remember failure is part of growth. Start a fresh and grow.</p> 

<p>   The best rep range for a beginners is 5x5 i.e 5 sets for 5 reps each set.</p>

<p>   The weight is 80% of your maximum weight for a squat is 50kgs, 
then 80% of this is 40kgs. Squat 40kgs for 5 reps for 5 sets.</p>  

<p>   The next best reps for mediate who has been in gym 
for 6 months to 1 year is 8-12 reps for 4-5 sets.</p> 

<p>    Remember your body weight is included in the reps you do.</p> 

<p>  <strong>   8. Don't make noise while at the gym. </strong> </p> 

<p>  Grinning like a Jackal. </p>  

<p>   No unnecessary talk and gossip.</p> 

<p>   Stay away from women if you are not gym instructor.</p> 

<p>   Don't go near gym beginners.</p>  

<p>   Leave your woman at home.</p> 

<p>   if she wants to join you that's fine but leave her to the instructor.</p> 

<p>    If you are insecure the gym instructor will tickle and spark your woman,</p> 

<p>  Then enrol her to women only gym or pairs her with a female instructor.</p>  

<p> <strong>   9. Has gym beginner, avoid supplements and steroids.</strong>  </p>  

<p>   The food you eat is enough.  Eat good food. </p>

<p>   Most supplements have soy or sugar or are synthetic. </p> 

<p>   The only supplement you MAY need are key minerals like magnesium, zinc, 
potassium and selenium.</p> 

<p>  The rest are plenty in the food you like eggs, meat and fish. </p>  

<p>    Don't eat raw eggs. </p> 

<p>    Bodybuilders use supplements and steroids because they go for competition,  
after the competition,  they detoxify themselves by injecting hormones.</p>  

<p>   The whole are affair is expensive for you.</p>  

<p>   Use the money to buy good food and clear the gym membership.</p>  

<p>  <strong>  10. Pre workout and post workout meals don't work.</strong> </p>  

<p>   Remember everything you just eat must go through digestion process for metabolism.</p>  

<p>   It doesn't work immediately.</p>

<p>  The powders you eat may work 4 hours later 
after spiking insulin and suppressing growth hormones and testosterone. </p> 

<p>   Anyone who sat in a class of biology understands this.</p>  



<p>  <strong>  11. Has GYM  BEGINNER, Be patient.</strong> </p>

<p>  It will take you up to 3 years to have the BODY framework you desire.</p> 

<p>  Remember it is A HEALTHY and FITNESS journey.</p>

<p>  FITNESS is A LIFELONG JOURNEY, not an event.</p>

    <p>   Also, know that you have been messing with your BODY for the last 10-20 years, 
and you won't get results in 2 months, and if your concern is seeing results, you will see none.</p>



<p><strong> 12. Don't  go to the GYM because you want to impress women. </strong></p>

<p>  That behavior is for SIMPS and ORBITERS.</p>

<p>    You go to the GYM because you are investing in your HEALTH.</p> 

<p> <strong> 13. Switch off the phone while at the GYM or turn off the notifications. </strong> </p>


<p>   Use the GYM wall clock or your wristwatch for time management. </p> 


<p>   Always rack back your weights. </p> 


<p>  Don't leave them scattered all over in the gym hall. </p> 


<p>   Be organized before and after the training. </p> 


<p>   This small, minute habit will be part of your lifestyle even beyond the gym.</p> 


<p>    After your WORKOUT,  rack/put the dumbbell weight back.</p> 


<p>   Don't mind others who never do it. </p> 


<p>   Don't be a lazy MAN. Respect the WORKERS in the GYM. </p> 


<p><strong>14. Sleep is very important. 8 hours of sleep is what you need.
</strong></p>
<p>  Without sleep, you are wasting your time in the gym. </p> 


<p><strong> 15. Posting your WORKOUTS photos and videos on social media for attention is a Feminine behavior.
We don't care.  </strong></p>


<p><strong> 16. Shoes don't matter. </strong></p>

<p>   The flatter the shoes,  the better your MIND-MUSCLE connection.</p>  

<p>  If you train barefoot, you will not get any injury unless a mental plate falls on your toes. </p>  

<p>  If this happens, you will even get stronger.</p> 

<p>   Pain makes you stronger and callous. </p> 

<p> <strong>    17. After consistence and resistance training,  your biomarker will improve. </strong></p>

<p>  You Will notice some changes in your SEXUAL performance.</p> 

<p> Don't injure your woman. </p> 
<p>  Have good sex with her. </p> 
<p> Let her fall in love with your new sexual life. </p> 

<p>  However if you have EJACULATION DYSFUNCTION or PREMATURE  EJACULATION, the results won't come easily.</p> 

<p><strong>18. Run only once a week.  The maximum running time is 45 minutes.
</strong></p>

<p>  You are not in marathon competition.</p> 

<p>  Running meant to improve your CARDIOPULMONARY ENDURANCE,  PERFORMANCE and EFFICIENCY. </p>  

<p>  There are is a reason why marathon runners are thin, skinnier and older than weight lifters. </p> 


<p><strong> 19. If you WEIGHT over 90kg, a void cardio and aerobic. It will mess your joints.  </strong></p>

<p> They are STRESSORS that will raise your CORTISOL and IMPEDE FATS lose or any muscular growth.</p>

<p> First reduce your WEIGHT below 90kgs by fixing your DIET,  
FASTING and engaging in later WORKOUTS like lifting weights, then join the aerobics. </p>


<p><strong>20. Lastly,  Don't steal my content without my acknowledging me. </strong></p>

<p>  I spend hours in the library reading and researching to help people get better. </p>
